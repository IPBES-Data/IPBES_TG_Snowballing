abstract: > 
    In addition to the typical literature search using search terms, one can conduct a snowball search. A snowball search starts from a set of identified key-papers, and the snowball search will identify the publications cited in the key papers as well as the publications citing the key-paper. This search strategy identifies related articles using citation relationships (not keywords), building a citation network based on the key-papers  Here we will demonstrate how a snowballing search can be conducted using [OpenAlex](https://OpenAlex.org) and R with code examples and discuss some shortcomings and advantages of this approach. Furthermore, we will outline some analysis approaches and possibilities of a citation network without going into too much detail
